                    I worked for an advertising agency for several years. I dealt with: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>creating graphic design for both computers and printing needs,</li>
                        <li>designing posters, business cards,</li>
                        <li>prints,</li>
                        <li>creating simple websites,</li>
                        <li>SEO for small and micro companies,</li>
                        <li>internet advertising campaigns,</li>
                        <li>uploading sites and keeping them on the server.</li>
                    </ul>
                    I also worked in hosting company. My duties included: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>customer service,</li>
                        <li>website migration,</li>
                        <li>help and management of client accounts from the server side (direct admin).</li>
                    </ul>
                    For over half a year I have been learning the latest technologies, in particular based on javascript. <br/>
                    My goal is to further develop, deepen and assimilate the latest trends in programming and javascript technologies. In particular, the MERN stack. <br/>
                    <hr/>
                    After hours, I like to relax doing sports (running, bike, squash, gym), traveling, learning something new about programming and the Japanese language.
